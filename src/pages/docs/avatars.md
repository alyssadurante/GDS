Avatars are used when you want to display a collection of users. You can also use them for easy collapse states for a set number of avatars and with a dropdown to show hidden users.

## Content

### Images

- Avatar images should by default use the initials variant and should only include an image if the user chooses to upload one.

## Variants

### Images Stacked

Simple stacked avatar groups are the default way to present groups of users.

### Initials Stacked

Default state for users without uploaded image.

### Hidden Users

When there are more than the alloted 4 avatars, use a numerical initials avatar to indicate how many users are not being shown.

### Hovering over a user

When hovering over a specific user, a tooltip will open up below the avatar to provide further detail of the user's name.
