Buttons are triggers for events or actions. They’re commonly used as part of larger components or patterns such as forms or modal dialogs.

---

## Overview

Buttons are clickable elements that are used to trigger actions. They communicate calls to action to the user and allow users to interact with pages in a variety of ways. Button labels express what action will occur when the user interacts with it.

1. **Icon (Optional)**: Use an icon to convey more meaning.
2. **Label**: Text that indicates the result of selecting the button.

## When to use

Use buttons to communicate actions users can take and to allow users to interact with the page. Each page should have one primary button, and any remaining calls to action should be represented as lower emphasis buttons.

## Content

### Labels

Buttons labels should be concise and clear enough to indicate the next action to the user

- Use concise, easy to scan, and clear button labels to indicate the next action to the user.
- Use sentence-case capitalization

## Variants

### Primary

Use a `primary` button to call attention to an action on a form or to highlight the strongest call to action on a page. Primary buttons should only appear once per container (not including the application header or in a modal dialog). Not every screen requires a primary button.

### White

Use a `white` button with a primary button for secondary actions, such as “Cancel".

### Error

The `error` button appears as a final confirmation for a destructive action such as deleting. These are found mostly in confirmation modals.

### Error

Use an error section message to let the user know when:

- something destructive or critical has happened
- access has been denied
- there are connectivity issues

### Icon

There are two variants for `icon` buttons, **leading** and **trailing**.

**Leading**

Display an icon before the text.
